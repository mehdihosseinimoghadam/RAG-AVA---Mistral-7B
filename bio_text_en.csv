0,38452919,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Glomerular disorders have a highly variable clinical course and biomarkers that reflect molecular mechanisms underlying progression are needed. Based on our previous work identifying plasminogen as a direct cause of podocyte injury, we designed this study to test the association between urine plasmin(ogen) (i.e., plasmin and its precursor plasminogen) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 1010 patients enrolled in the CureGN Cohort with biopsy-proven glomerular disease (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy).
PREDICTORS: The main predictor was urine plasmin(ogen) at baseline. Levels were measured by an electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay developed de novo. Traditional clinical and analytical characteristics were used for adjustment. The ratio of urine plasmin(ogen)/ expected plasmin(ogen) was evaluated as a predictor in a separate model.
OUTCOMES: Progression to ESKD.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox regression was used to examine the association between urinary plasmin(ogen) and time to ESKD. Urinary markers were Log
RESULTS: Adjusted Log
LIMITATIONS: Single plasmin(ogen) determination does not allow for the study of changes over time. The use of a cohort of mostly white patients and the restriction to patients with 3 glomerular disorders limits the external validity of our analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary plasmin(ogen) and the ratio of measured/expected plasmin(ogen) are independently associated with ESKD in a cohort of patients with glomerular disease. Taken together with our previous experimental findings, urinary plasmin(ogen) could be a useful biomarker in prognostic decision making and a target for the development of novel therapies in patients with proteinuria and glomerular disease."
1,38448735,"Synthetic signaling receptors enable programmable cellular responses coupling with customized inputs. However, engineering a designer force-sensing receptor to rewire mechanotransduction remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce nongenetically engineered artificial mechanoreceptors (AMRs) capable of reprogramming non-mechanoresponsive receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to sense user-defined force cues, enabling de novo-designed mechanotransduction. AMR is a modular DNA-protein chimera comprising a mechanosensing-and-transmitting DNA nanodevice grafted on natural RTKs via aptameric anchors. AMR senses intercellular tensile force via an allosteric DNA mechano-switch with tunable piconewton-sensitive force tolerance, actuating a force-triggered dynamic DNA assembly to manipulate RTK dimerization and activate intracellular signaling. By swapping the force-reception ligands, we demonstrate the AMR-mediated activation of c-Met, a representative RTK, in response to the cellular tensile forces mediated by cell-adhesion proteins (integrin, E-cadherin) or membrane protein endocytosis (CI-M6PR). Moreover, AMR also allows the reprogramming of FGFR1, another RTK, to customize mechanobiological function, for example, adhesion-mediated neural stem cell maintenance."
2,38442440,"Application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery has led to several success stories in recent times. While traditional methods mostly relied upon screening large chemical libraries for early-stage drug-design, de novo design can help identify novel target-specific molecules by sampling from a much larger chemical space. Although this has increased the possibility of finding diverse and novel molecules from previously unexplored chemical space, this has also posed a great challenge for medicinal chemists to synthesize at least some of the de novo designed novel molecules for experimental validation. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel forward synthesis-based generative AI method, which is used to explore the synthesizable chemical space. The method uses a structure-based drug design framework, where the target protein structure and a target-specific seed fragment from co-crystal structures can be the initial inputs. A random fragment from a purchasable fragment library can also be the input if a target-specific fragment is unavailable. Then a template-based forward synthesis route prediction and molecule generation is performed in parallel using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method where, the subsequent fragments for molecule growth can again be obtained from a purchasable fragment library. The rewards for each iteration of MCTS are computed using a drug-target affinity (DTA) model based on the docking pose of the generated reaction intermediates at the binding site of the target protein of interest. With the help of the proposed method, it is now possible to overcome one of the major obstacles posed to the AI-based drug design approaches through the ability of the method to design novel target-specific synthesizable molecules."
3,38438864,"OBJECTIVES: Soybean is an important feed and oil crop in the world due to its high protein and oil content. China has a collection of more than 43,000 soybean germplasm resources, which provides a rich genetic diversity for soybean breeding. However, the rich genetic diversity poses great challenges to the genetic improvement of soybean. This study reports on the de novo genome assembly of HJ117, a soybean variety with high protein content of 52.99%. These data will prove to be valuable resources for further soybean quality improvement research, and will aid in the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms underlying soybean protein content.
DATA DESCRIPTION: We generated a contiguous reference genome of 1041.94 Mb for HJ117 using a combination of Illumina short reads (23.38 Gb) and PacBio long reads (25.58 Gb), with high-quality sequence coverage of approximately 22.44× and 24.55×, respectively. HJ117 was developed through backcross breeding, using Jidou 12 as the recurrent parent and Chamoshidou as the donor parent. The assembly was further assisted by 114.5 Gb Hi-C data (109.9×), resulting in a contig N50 of 19.32 Mb and scaffold N50 of 51.43 Mb. Notably, Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) assessment and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) assessment results indicated that most core eukaryotic genes (97.18%) and genes in the BUSCO dataset (99.4%) were identified, and 96.44% of the genomic sequences were anchored onto twenty pseudochromosomes."
4,38438446,"Colocalization of microbial pathogens and the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suggests that microbial infection may play a role in sporadic AD. Aβ exhibits antimicrobial activity against numerous pathogens, supporting a potential role for Aβ in the innate immune response. While mammalian amyloid is associated with disease, many bacteria form amyloid fibrils to fortify the biofilm that protects the cells from the surrounding environment. In the microbial AD hypothesis, Aβ aggregates in response to infection to combat the pathogen. We hypothesize that this occurs through toxic Aβ oligomers that contain α-sheet structure and form prior to fibrillization. De novo designed α-sheet peptides specifically bind to the α-sheet structure present in the oligomers of both bacterial and mammalian amyloidogenic proteins to neutralize toxicity and inhibit aggregation. Here, we measure the effect of E. coli on Aβ, including upregulation, aggregation, and toxicity. Additionally, we determined the effect of Aβ structure on E. coli amyloid fibrils, or curli comprised of the CsgA protein, and biofilm formation. We found that curli formation by E. coli increased Aβ oligomer production, and Aβ oligomers inhibited curli biogenesis and reduced biofilm cell density. Further, curli and biofilm inhibition by Aβ oligomers increased E. coli susceptibility to gentamicin. Toxic oligomers of Aβ and CsgA interact via α-sheet interactions, neutralizing their toxicity. These results suggest that exposure to toxic oligomers formed by microbial pathogens triggers Aβ oligomer upregulation and aggregation to combat infection via selective interactions between α-sheet oligomers to neutralize toxicity of both species with subsequent inhibition of fibrillization."

De novo enzyme design faces challenges due to the complexity of enzymatic catalysis. An alternative approach involves expanding natural enzyme capabilities for new substrates and parameters. Here, we introduce CoSaNN (Conformation Sampling using Neural Network), an enzyme design strategy using deep learning for structure prediction and sequence optimization. CoSaNN controls enzyme conformations to expand chemical space beyond simple mutagenesis. It employs a context-dependent approach for generating enzyme designs, considering non-linear relationships in sequence and structure space. We also developed SolvIT, a graph NN predicting protein solubility in "
6,38431892,"Many proteins do not fold into a fixed three-dimensional structure, but rather function in a highly disordered state. These intrinsically disordered proteins pose a unique challenge to protein engineering and design: How can proteins be designed de novo if not by tailoring their structure? Here, we will review the nascent field of design of intrinsically disordered proteins with focus on applications in biotechnology and medicine. The design goals should not necessarily be the same as for de novo design of folded proteins as disordered proteins have unique functional strengths and limitations. We focus on functions where intrinsically disordered proteins are uniquely suited including disordered linkers, desiccation chaperones, sensors of the chemical environment, delivery of pharmaceuticals, and constituents of biomolecular condensates. Design of functional intrinsically disordered proteins relies on a combination of computational tools and heuristics gleaned from sequence-function studies. There are few cases where intrinsically disordered proteins have made it into industrial applications. However, we argue that disordered proteins can perform many roles currently performed by organic polymers, and that these proteins might be more designable due to their modularity."
7,38417762,"Silk, especially spider and insect silk, is a highly versatile biomaterial with potential applications in biomedicine, materials science, and biomimetic engineering. The primary structure of silk proteins is the basis for the mechanical properties of silk fibers. Biotechnologies such as single-molecule sequencing have facilitated an increasing number of reports on new silk genes and assembled silk proteins. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in representative spider and insect silk proteins, focusing on identification methods, sequence characteristics, and de novo design and assembly. The review discusses three identification methods for silk genes: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sequencing, PCR-free cloning and sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. Moreover, it reveals the main spider and insect silk proteins and their sequences. Subsequent de novo assembly of artificial silk is covered and future research directions in the field of silk proteins, including new silk genes, customizable artificial silk, and the expansion of silk production and applications are discussed. This review provides a basis for the genetic aspects of silk production and the potential applications of artificial silk in material science and biomedical engineering."

9,38392046,"Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (aUC) presents a significant challenge with high mortality rates. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the established frontline standard of care, and a switch-maintenance strategy with immunotherapy has now emerged as a new standard for aUC patients without disease progression, following initial platinum therapy. Examining the treatment patterns is imperative, given the evolving therapeutic landscape. In this study, we conducted a retrospective medical chart review of 17 Canadian oncologists treating patients with aUC to assess unmet needs in Canadian aUC patient care. Data from 146 patient charts were analyzed, revealing important clinical insights about the management of aUC. A substantial proportion of patients (53%) presented with de novo metastatic disease, which was possibly influenced by pandemic-related care disruptions. Variability was evident in the cisplatin eligibility criteria, with a majority (70%) of oncologists utilizing a 50 mL/min threshold. Most favored four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy to spare the bone marrow for future therapies and prevent patient fatigue. Notably, some eligible patients were kept under surveillance rather than receiving maintenance therapy, suggesting a potential gap in awareness regarding evidence-based recommendations. Furthermore, managing treatment-related adverse events was found to be one of the biggest challenges in relation to maintenance immunotherapy. In conclusion, our findings provide the first comprehensive overview of aUC treatment patterns in Canada following the approval of maintenance immunotherapy, offering insights into the decision-making process and underscoring the importance of evidence-based guidelines in aUC patient management."
0,38455212,"The efficacy of administering high doses of vitamin D to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 remains uncertain. We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science) from inception until August 2022, with no limitations on language, to locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the impact of high-dose vitamin D supplementation (defined as a single dose of ≥100,000 IU or daily dose of ≥10,000 IU reaching a total dose of ≥100,000 IU) on COVID-19 patients. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI were calculated. Our meta-analysis included 5 RCTs with a total of 834 patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation did not show any significant benefits for mortality ("
1,38451442,"Several nutrients are crucial in enhancing the immune system and preserving the structural integrity of bodily tissue barriers. Vitamin D (VD) and zinc (Zn) have received considerable interest due to their immunomodulatory properties and ability to enhance the body's immune defenses. Due to their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and immunomodulatory properties, the two nutritional powerhouses VD and Zn are crucial for innate and adaptive immunity. As observed with COVID-19, deficiencies in these micronutrients impair immune responses, increasing susceptibility to viral infections and severe disease. Ensuring an adequate intake of VD and Zn emerges as a promising strategy for fortifying the immune system. Ongoing clinical trials are actively investigating their potential therapeutic advantages. Beyond the immediate context of the pandemic, these micronutrients offer valuable tools for enhancing immunity and overall well-being, especially in the face of future viral threats. This analysis emphasizes the enduring significance of VD and Zn as both treatment and preventive measures against potential viral challenges beyond the current health crisis. The overview delves into the immunomodulatory potential of VD and Zn in combating viral infections, with particular attention to their effects on animals. It provides a comprehensive summary of current research findings regarding their individual and synergistic impacts on immune function, underlining their potential in treating and preventing viral infections. Overall, this overview underscores the need for further research to understand how VD and Zn can modulate the immune response in combatting viral diseases in animals."

5,38400105,"BACKGROUND: Structural and functional commonalities between poliovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggest that poliovirus inoculation may induce antibodies that mitigate the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). No known studies have evaluated COVID-19 risk factors in adults recently vaccinated against poliovirus.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Among adults with no history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination, who recently received an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), we sought to determine which biological factors and social determinants of health (SDOH) may be associated with (1) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, (2) experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and (3) a longer duration of COVID-19 symptoms.
METHODS: The influence of biological factors and SDOH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms were evaluated among 282 adults recently inoculated with IPV. Participant-reported surveys were analyzed over 12 months post-enrollment. Bivariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models identified associations between variables and COVID-19 outcomes.
RESULTS: Adjusting for COVID-19 vaccinations, variants, and other SDOH, secondary analyses revealed that underlying conditions, employment, vitamin D, education, and the oral poliovirus vaccination (OPV) were associated with COVID-19 outcomes. The odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing symptoms were significantly reduced among participants who took vitamin D (OR 0.12 and OR 0.09, respectively). Unemployed or part-time working participants were 72% less likely to test positive compared with full-time workers. No prior dose of OPV was one of the strongest predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.36) and COVID-19 symptoms (OR 6.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that prophylactic measures and mucosal immunity may mitigate the risk and severity of COVID-19 outcomes. Larger-scale studies may inform future policies."
6,38399417,"The progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to a hospitalization rate of 20%. The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases with age, resulting in severe and atypical clinical forms of the disease. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly population can be attributed to several factors, including the overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, immunosenescence, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota that facilitate the cytokine storm. In light of these observations, we conducted a retrospective analysis based on prospectively collected data between 23 December 2021 and 30 April 2022 (the fourth wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection). We analyzed patients aged over 60 years who were hospitalized in a county hospital in Romania. The primary objective of our study was to assess the risk factors for an unfavorable outcome, while the secondary objective was to assess the clinical and baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients. We included 287 cases with a complete electronic medical record from this available cohort of patients. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate a group of 127 patients that progressed, unfortunately, toward an unfavorable outcome versus 160 patients with a favorable outcome. We used the Combined Ordinal Scale of Severity that combines the WHO ordinal scale and the degrees of inflammation to assess the severity of the patients at the time of the initial assessment. The age group between 70 and 79 years had the highest percentage, accounting for 48.0%-61 patients, of the deceased patients. We noted statistically significant differences between groups related to other cardiovascular diseases, nutritional status, hematological diseases, other neurological/mental or digestive disorders, and other comorbidities. Regarding the nutritional status of the patients, there was a statistically significant unfavorable outcome for all the age groups and the patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m"
7,38398782,"Vitamin D, a steroid hormone synthesized primarily in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet light, is widely deficient across global populations. This study aimed to fill the data gap in Western Romania by measuring 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in a cohort of 7141 from Arad County. It was observed that women, younger adults (18-29 years), and older adults (70-79 years) had notably lower vitamin D levels compared to the average population. Additionally, there was a rise in vitamin D levels over the four-year span of 2018-2022, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research provides fresh data on those most susceptible to vitamin D deficiency and lays the groundwork for educational campaigns on vitamin D supplementation benefits."

9,38396804,"Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D3 is synthesised in skin cells in the body. Vitamin D3 has been known as a bone-related hormone. Recently, however, it has been considered as an immune vitamin. Vitamin D3 deficiency influences the onset of a variety of diseases. Vitamin D3 regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) through binding to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in immune cells. Since blood levels of vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) were low in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, there has been growing interest in the importance of vitamin D3 to maintaining a healthy condition. On the other hand, phytochemicals are compounds derived from plants with over 7000 varieties and have various biological activities. They mainly have health-promoting effects and are classified as terpenoids, carotenoids, flavonoids, etc. Flavonoids are known as the anti-inflammatory compounds that control TNF-α production. Chronic inflammation is induced by the continuous production of TNF-α and is the fundamental cause of diseases like obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, heart and brain diseases, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. In addition, the ageing process is induced by chronic inflammation. This review explains the cooperative effects of vitamin D3 and phytochemicals in the suppression of inflammatory responses, how it balances the natural immune response, and its link to anti-ageing effects. In addition, vitamin D3 and phytochemicals synergistically contribute to anti-ageing by working with ageing-related genes. Furthermore, prevention of ageing processes induced by the chronic inflammation requires the maintenance of healthy gut microbiota, which is related to daily dietary habits. In this regard, supplementation of vitamin D3 and phytochemicals plays an important role. Recently, the association of the prevention of the non-disease condition called ""ME-BYO"" with the maintenance of a healthy condition has been an attractive regimen, and the anti-ageing effect discussed here is important for a healthy and long life."
0,38456511,"Understanding the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is critical to optimizing vaccination strategies for individuals with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we comprehensively analyzed innate and adaptive immune responses in 19 patients with SLE receiving a complete 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) regimen compared with a control cohort of 56 healthy control (HC) volunteers. Patients with SLE exhibited impaired neutralizing antibody production and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses relative to HC. Interestingly, antibody responses were only altered in patients with SLE treated with immunosuppressive therapies, whereas impairment of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers was independent of medication. Patients with SLE also displayed reduced levels of circulating CXC motif chemokine ligands, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-γ after secondary vaccination as well as downregulation of gene expression pathways indicative of compromised innate immune responses. Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis reveals that patients with SLE showed reduced levels of a vaccine-inducible monocyte population characterized by overexpression of IFN-response transcription factors. Thus, although 2 doses of BNT162b2 induced relatively robust immune responses in patients with SLE, our data demonstrate impairment of both innate and adaptive immune responses relative to HC, highlighting a need for population-specific vaccination studies."
1,38455695,"INTRODUCTION: Large-scale clinical studies for COVID-19 vaccines have shown the infection-preventing effect and short-term adverse effects. Some rare illnesses such as eosinophilia can develop following COVID-19 vaccinations.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of 65-year-old man with unexplained abdominal pain that developed 2 weeks after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. The patient had received a second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and revealed eosinophilia at the first visit to our hospital. Eosinophil infiltration was observed in the lamina propria of the duodenum by a step biopsy. Montelukast 10 mg was administered as the initial treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE), and the abdominal pain was improved.
DISCUSSION: The strong influence of COVID-19 vaccination on the development of EGE remains unproven. Reports of eosinophilia following COVID-19 vaccination have discussed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination triggered an eosinophilic response.
CONCLUSION: This case presented EGE that developed following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, which would be a rare adverse event.
LEARNING POINTS: Eosinophilia can develop following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.To evaluate the relationships of these illnesses with vaccination, clinicians should collect information on vaccinations history and vaccination dates through interviews.It is clinically practical to know the differential diseases that may develop after a new vaccination."
2,38455062,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with B cell-depleting drugs induced limited seroconversion but robust cellular response. We aimed to document specific T and B cell immunity in response to vaccine booster doses and breakthrough infection (BTI).
METHODS: We included 76 RA patients treated with rituximab who received up to four SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses or three doses plus BTI, in addition to vaccinated healthy donors (HD) and control patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi). We quantified anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) Spike IgG, anti-nucleocapsid (NC) IgG, 92 circulating inflammatory proteins, Spike-binding B cells, and Spike-specific T cells along with comprehensive high-dimensional phenotyping and functional assays.
FINDINGS: The time since the last rituximab infusion, persistent inflammation, and age were associated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG seroconversion. The vaccine-elicited serological response was accompanied by an incomplete induction of peripheral Spike-specific memory B cells but occurred independently of T cell responses. Vaccine- and BTI-elicited cellular immunity was similar between RA and HD 
INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in RA can induce persistent effector T-cell responses that are reactivated by BTI. Paused rituximab medication allowed serological responses after a booster dose (D4), especially in RA with lower inflammation, enabling efficient humoral and cellular immunity after BTI, and contributed overall to the development of potential durable immunity."
3,38454762,"BACKGROUND: The unexpected detection of axillary lymphadenopathy (AxL) in cancer patients (pts) represents a real concern during the COVID-19 vaccination era. Benign reactions may take place after vaccine inoculation, which can mislead image interpretation in patients undergoing F-18-FDG, F-18-Choline, and Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT. They may also mimic loco-regional metastases or disease. We assessed PET/CT findings after COVID-19 first dose vaccination in cancer patients and the impact on their disease course management.
METHODS: We evaluated 333 patients undergoing PET/CT (257 F-18-FDG, 54 F-18-Choline, and 23 Ga-68 DOTATOC) scans after the first vaccination with mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) (study group; SG). The uptake index (SUVmax) of suspected AxL was defined as significant when the ratio was >1.5 as compared to the contralateral lymph nodes. Besides, co-registered CT (Co-CT) features of target lymph nodes were evaluated. Nodes with aggregate imaging positivity were further investigated.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of apparently positive lymph nodes on PET scans was 17.1% during the vaccination period. 107 pts of the same setting, who had undergone PET/CT before the COVID-19 pandemic, represented the control group (CG). Only 3 patients of CG showed reactive lymph nodes with a prevalence of 2.8% (p < 0.001 as compared to the vaccination period). 84.2% of SG patients exhibited benign characteristics on co-CT images and only 9 pts needed thorough appraisal.
CONCLUSION: The correct interpretation of images is crucial to avoid unnecessary treatments and invasive procedures in vaccinated cancer pts. A detailed anamnestic interview and the analysis of lymph nodes' CT characteristics, after performing PET/CT, may help to clear any misleading diagnosis."
4,38454385,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the waning of immunity raise concerns about vaccine effectiveness and protection against COVID-19. While antibody response has been shown to correlate with the risk of infection with the original variant and earlier variants of concern, the effectiveness of antibody-mediated protection against Omicron and the factors associated with protection remain uncertain.
METHODS: We evaluated antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens from Wuhan and variants of concern by Luminex and their role in preventing breakthrough infections 1 year after a third dose of mRNA vaccination, in a cohort of health care workers followed since the pandemic onset in Spain (N = 393). Data were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 history, demographic factors, comorbidities, vaccine doses, brand, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Higher levels of anti-S IgG and IgA to Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron were associated with protection against vaccine breakthroughs (IgG against Omicron S antigen HR, 0.06, 95%CI, 0.26-0.01). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was positively associated with antibody levels and protection against breakthroughs, and a longer time since last infection was associated with lower protection. In addition, priming with BNT162b2 followed by mRNA-1273 booster was associated with higher antibody responses than homologous mRNA-1273 vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Data show that IgG and IgA induced by vaccines against the original strain or by hybrid immunization are valid correlates of protection against Omicron BA.1 despite immune escape and support the benefits of heterologous vaccination regimens to enhance antibodies and the prioritization of booster vaccination in individuals without recent infections."
5,38454077,"There is currently limited data on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 6-11 years in Malaysia. This study aims to determine vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-related hospitalization after receipt of one- and two-doses of BNT162b2 mRNA (Comirnaty-Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine over a duration of almost 1 year in the predominantly Omicron period of BA.4/BA.5 and X.B.B sub lineages. This study linked administrative databases between May 2022 and March 2023 to evaluate real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the BNT162b2 mRNA (Comirnaty-Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine against COVID-19-related hospitalization in the Omicron pre-dominant period with BA.4/BA.5 and X.B.B sub lineages. During the Omicron-predominant period, the cumulative hospitalization rate was almost two times higher for unvaccinated children (9.6 per million population) compared to vaccinated children (6 per million population). The estimated VE against COVID-19 hospitalization for one dose of BNT162b2 was 27% (95% CI - 1%, 47%) and 38% (95% CI 27%, 48%) for two doses. The estimated VE against hospitalization remained stable when stratified by time. VE for the first 90 days was estimated to be 45% (95% CI 33, 55%), followed by 47% (95% CI 34, 56%) between 90 and 180 days, and 36% (95% CI 22, 45%) between 180 and 360 days. Recent infection within 6 months does not appear to modify the impact of vaccination on the risk of hospitalization, subject to the caveat of potential underestimation. In our pediatric population, BNT162b2 provided moderate-non-diminishing protection against COVID-19 hospitalization over almost 1 year of Omicron predominance."

8,38452010,"In the United States, most real-world estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness are based on data drawn from large health systems or sentinel populations. More data is needed to understand how the benefits of vaccination may vary across US populations with disparate risk profiles and policy contexts. We aimed to provide estimates of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against moderate and severe outcomes of COVID-19 based on state population-level data sources. Using statewide integrated administrative and clinical data and a test-negative case-control study design, we assessed mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits among adults in South Carolina. We presented estimates of vaccine effectiveness at discrete time intervals for adults who received one, two or three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine compared to adults who were unvaccinated. We also evaluated changes in vaccine effectiveness over time (waning) for the overall sample and in subgroups defined by age. We showed that while two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were initially highly effective, vaccine effectiveness waned as time elapsed since the second dose. Compared to protection against hospitalizations, protection against emergency department visits was found to wane more sharply. In all cases, a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine conferred significant gains in protection relative to waning protection after two doses. Further, over more than 120 days of follow-up, the data revealed relatively limited waning of vaccine effectiveness after a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine."
9,38450722,"Over the past year, an unexpected surge in human monkeypox (hMPX) cases has been observed. This outbreak differs from previous ones, displaying distinct epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns, believed to be influenced by a newly emerging monkeypox virus (MPXV) lineage. Notably, this emerging MPXV lineage has exhibited several non-synonymous mutations, some of which are linked to immunomodulatory activities and antigenic characteristics that aid in host detection. However, specific treatments or vaccines for human monkeypox are currently lacking. Hence, we aim to develop a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine by using immunoinformatics approaches against the MPXV, particularly its emerging variants. Six proteins (A29L, A35R, B6R, M1R, H3L, and E8L) were chosen for epitope and mutation site identification. Seventeen top-performing epitopes and eight epitopes containing mutation sites were selected and combined with adjuvants, the PADRE sequence, and linkers for vaccine development. The molecular and physical properties of the designed vaccine (WLmpx) were favorable.

0,38451822,"It is hoped that artificial enzymes designed in laboratories can be efficient alternatives to chemical catalysts that have been used to synthesize organic molecules. However, the design of artificial enzymes is challenging and requires a detailed molecular-level analysis to understand the mechanism they promote in order to design efficient variants. In this study, we computationally investigate the mechanism of proficient Morita-Baylis-Hillman enzymes developed using a combination of computational design and directed evolution. The powerful transition path sampling method coupled with in-depth post-processing analysis has been successfully used to elucidate the different chemical pathways, transition states, protein dynamics, and free energy barriers of reactions catalyzed by such laboratory-optimized enzymes. This research provides an explanation for how different chemical modifications in an enzyme affect its catalytic activity in ways that are not predictable by static design algorithms."

2,38434363,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in 2019 following prior outbreaks of coronaviruses like SARS and MERS in recent decades, underscoring their high potential of infectivity in humans. Insights from previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS have played a significant role in developing effective strategies to mitigate the global impact of SARS-CoV-2. As of January 7, 2024, there have been 774,075,242 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. To date, 13.59 billion vaccine doses have been administered, and there have been 7,012,986 documented fatalities (https://www.who.int/) Despite significant progress in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges human defenses, presenting ongoing global challenges. The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 lineages, shaped by mutation and recombination processes, has led to successive waves of infections. This scenario reveals the need for next-generation vaccines as a crucial requirement for ensuring ongoing protection against SARS-CoV-2. This demand calls for formulations that trigger a robust adaptive immune response without leading the acute inflammation linked with the infection. Key mutations detected in the Spike protein, a critical target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design -specifically within the Receptor Binding Domain region of Omicron variant lineages (B.1.1.529), currently dominant worldwide, have intensified concerns due to their association with immunity evasion from prior vaccinations and infections. As the world deals with this evolving threat, the narrative extends to the realm of emerging variants, each displaying new mutations with implications that remain largely misunderstood. Notably, the JN.1 Omicron lineage is gaining global prevalence, and early findings suggest it stands among the immune-evading variants, a characteristic attributed to its mutation L455S. Moreover, the detrimental consequences of the novel emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages bear a particularly critical impact on immunocompromised individuals and older adults. Immunocompromised individuals face challenges such as suboptimal responses to COVID-19 vaccines, rendering them more susceptible to severe disease. Similarly, older adults have an increased risk of severe disease and the presence of comorbid conditions, find themselves at a heightened vulnerability to develop COVID-19 disease. Thus, recognizing these intricate factors is crucial for effectively tailoring public health strategies to protect these vulnerable populations. In this context, this review aims to describe, analyze, and discuss the current progress of the next-generation treatments encompassing immunotherapeutic approaches and advanced therapies emerging as complements that will offer solutions to counter the disadvantages of the existing options. Preliminary outcomes show that these strategies target the virus and address the immunomodulatory responses associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, the capacity to promote tissue repair has been demonstrated, which can be particularly noteworthy for immunocompromised individuals who stand as vulnerable actors in the global landscape of coronavirus infections. The emerging next-generation treatments possess broader potential, offering protection against a wide range of variants and enhancing the ability to counter the impact of the constant evolution of the virus. Furthermore, advanced therapies are projected as potential treatment alternatives for managing Chronic Post-COVID-19 syndromeand addressing its associated long-term complications."

5,38428393,"Chloroplasts are green plastids in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic algae and plants responsible for photosynthesis. The plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) plays an essential role during chloroplast biogenesis from proplastids and functions as the predominant RNA polymerase in mature chloroplasts. The PEP-centered transcription apparatus comprises a bacterial-origin PEP core and more than a dozen eukaryotic-origin PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nucleus. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structures of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) PEP-PAP apoenzyme and PEP-PAP transcription elongation complexes at near-atomic resolutions. Our data show the PEP core adopts a typical fold as bacterial RNAP. Fifteen PAPs bind at the periphery of the PEP core, facilitate assembling the PEP-PAP supercomplex, protect the complex from oxidation damage, and likely couple gene transcription with RNA processing. Our results report the high-resolution architecture of the chloroplast transcription apparatus and provide the structural basis for the mechanistic and functional study of transcription regulation in chloroplasts."
6,38414298,"An urgent need for effective surveillance strategies arose due to the global emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although vaccines and antivirals are available, concerns persist about the evolution of new variants with potentially increased infectivity, transmissibility, and immune evasion. Therefore, variant monitoring is crucial for public health decision-making. Wastewater-based surveillance has proven to be an effective tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants within populations. Specific SARS-CoV-2 variants are detected and quantified in wastewater in this study using a reverse transcriptase digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) approach. The 11 designed assays were first validated in silico using a substantial dataset of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to ensure comprehensive variant coverage. The assessment of the sensitivity and specificity with reference material showed the capability of the developed assays to reliably identify target mutations while minimizing false positives and false negatives. The applicability of the assays was evaluated using wastewater samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Ghent, Belgium. The quantification of the specific mutations linked to the variants of concern present in these samples was calculated using these assays based on the detection of single mutations, which confirms their use for real-world variant surveillance. In conclusion, this study provides an adaptable protocol to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater with high sensitivity and specificity. Its potential for broader application in other viral surveillance contexts highlights its added value for rapid response to emerging infectious diseases. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Robust RT-ddPCR methodology for specific SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern detection in wastewater. Rigorous validation that demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity. Demonstration of real-world applicability using wastewater samples. Valuable tool for rapid response to emerging infectious diseases."
7,38413010,"Biomolecular research traditionally revolves around comprehending the mechanisms through which peptides or proteins facilitate specific functions, often driven by their relevance to clinical ailments. This conventional approach assumes that unraveling mechanisms is a prerequisite for wielding control over functionality, which stands as the ultimate research goal. However, an alternative perspective emerges from physics-based inverse design, shifting the focus from mechanisms to the direct acquisition of functional control strategies. By embracing this methodology, we can uncover solutions that might not have direct parallels in natural systems, yet yield crucial insights into the isolated molecular elements dictating functionality. This provides a distinctive comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.In this context, we elucidate how physics-based inverse design, facilitated by evolutionary algorithms and coarse-grained molecular simulations, charts a promising course for innovating the reverse engineering of biopolymers interacting with intricate fluid phases such as lipid membranes and liquid protein phases. We introduce evolutionary molecular dynamics (Evo-MD) simulations, an approach that merges evolutionary algorithms with the Martini coarse-grained force field. This method directs the evolutionary process from random amino acid sequences toward peptides interacting with complex fluid phases such as biological lipid membranes, offering significant promises in the development of peptide-based sensors and drugs. This approach can be tailored to recognize or selectively target specific attributes such as membrane curvature, lipid composition, membrane phase (e.g., lipid rafts), and protein fluid phases. Although the resulting optimal solutions may not perfectly align with biological norms, physics-based inverse design excels at isolating relevant physicochemical principles and thermodynamic driving forces governing optimal biopolymer interaction within complex fluidic environments. In addition, we expound upon how physics-based evolution using the Evo-MD approach can be harnessed to extract the evolutionary optimization fingerprints of protein-lipid interactions from native proteins. Finally, we outline how such an approach is uniquely able to generate strategic training data for predictive neural network models that cover the whole relevant physicochemical domain. Exploring challenges, we address key considerations such as choosing a fitting fitness function to delineate the desired functionality. Additionally, we scrutinize assumptions tied to system setup, the targeted protein structure, and limitations posed by the utilized (coarse-grained) force fields and explore potential strategies for guiding evolution with limited experimental data. This discourse encapsulates the potential and remaining obstacles of physics-based inverse design, paving the way for an exciting frontier in biomolecular research."

Here, we showed that UNC-5 is a heparin-binding protein, determined its structure bound to a heparin fragment, and could modulate UNC-5-heparin affinity using a directed evolution platform or structure-based rational design. We demonstrated that UNC-5 and UNC-6/netrin form a large, stable, and rigid complex in the presence of heparin, and heparin and UNC-5 exclude the attractive UNC-40/DCC receptor from binding to UNC-6/netrin to a large extent.
